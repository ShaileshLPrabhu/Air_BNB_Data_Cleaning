# TidyNest: Cleaning and Organizing Airbnb Data

Welcome to **TidyNest**, where we roll up our sleeves and give Airbnb data a thorough scrub! üßºüè†

## Project Overview
In this project, I took on an Airbnb dataset sourced from Kaggle. The goal? To transform it from a messy room into a sparkling suite of clean, organized data. Here's how I tidied things up:

1. **Null Values and Duplicates**: I hunted down those pesky nulls and duplicates, evicting them like unwanted guests.
2. **Symbol Removal**: Some columns had unnecessary symbols‚Äîlike old wallpaper peeling off the walls. I carefully scraped them away.
3. **Data Type Consistency**: Mismatched data types? Not on my watch! I made sure everything was in its proper place.
4. **Outlier Detection**: Outliers were like noisy neighbors disrupting the peace. I used the IQR method to politely ask them to leave.
5. **Final Touch**: With the data gleaming, I saved it to a new CSV file‚Äîa fresh start for our Airbnb adventure.

## Thank you!
